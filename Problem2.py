#I implemented a Python function that sorts the list of words and then processes them in reverse order to identify the longest word that meets the criteria. The algorithm starts by initializing an empty string l to store the longest valid word and iterates through the sorted list from the end to the beginning. For each word, it checks if all its prefixes are also present in the list by progressively removing the last character and verifying the remaining substring. If all prefixes are found, the current word is a valid candidate for the longest word. The final result is the longest valid word found. The time complexity is O(nlogn+n⋅k^2), where n is the number of words and k is the average length of the words, due to sorting and prefix checking. The space complexity is O(n⋅k) for storing the words and intermediate strings.

class Solution:
    def longestWord(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
        l = ""
        t = []
        words.sort()
        for i in range(len(words)-1,-1,-1):
            if l and len(words[i]) < len(l):
                continue
            flag = True
            m = words[i]
            a = list(words[i])
            while len(a) > 1:
                a.pop(-1)
                if ''.join(a) in words:
                    a = list(''.join(a))
                else:
                    flag = False
            if flag == True:
                l = m
        return l
